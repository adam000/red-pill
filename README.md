Red Pill is a game by [xiongchiamiov](https://github.com/xiongchiamiov) and [adam000](https://github.com/adam000) for the [2014 Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/jam-sites/cal-poly) at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. The game jam had the theme "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are." ([source](http://globalgamejam.org/news/ggj14-theme)) 

Take the red pill, and you'll see the differences between what we think we see and the sinister reality underneath.
